I found some audiobooks for my little son that were on vinil in my childhood. But he couldn't select a specific title in a playlist because he couldn't read yet. So I decided to add cover images of the records to the mp3 files I had.

Save the script file to your computer and use Terminal/CMD to launch it

```
	$ python path_to_the_script_directory_goes_here/add_cover_img_to_mp3.py path_to_mp3 path_to_img
```
or
```
	$ python path_to_the_script_directory_goes_here/add_cover_img_to_mp3.py
```
If you didn't provide the paths to mp3 files and images on launching, the script will ask for them later.
