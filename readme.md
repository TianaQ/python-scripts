### Adding cover image to mp3 file
* [add_cover_img_to_mp3.py](https://github.com/TianaQ/python-scripts/blob/master/add_cover_img_to_mp3.py)  

I found some audiobooks for my little son that were on vinil in my childhood. But he couldn't select a specific title in a playlist because he couldn't read yet. So I decided to add cover images of the records to the mp3 files I had. Maybe, you need that too?

Put your mp3 files and jpg or png files in a directory (it may be the same directory for all files). Use the same names for an mp3 file and the corresponding image. Save the script file to your computer and use Terminal/CMD to launch it

```
	$ python path_to_the_script_directory_goes_here/add_cover_img_to_mp3.py path_to_mp3 path_to_img
```
or
```
	$ python path_to_the_script_directory_goes_here/add_cover_img_to_mp3.py
```
If you didn't provide the paths to mp3 files and images on launching, the script will ask for them later.
